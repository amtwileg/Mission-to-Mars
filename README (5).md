# Module 10

## Deliverable 1
Scraping code was written to pull images from the website. This was done slightly differently than in the instructions, but the instructions said this was okay.

## Deliverable 2
The scraping.py file was updated to include the scraping code written in Deliverable 1

## Deliverable 3
The changes I made are as follows:
1. Made the grid of images responsive:
   1. 1 row of 4 columns in medium and large screens
   2. 2 rows of 2 columns in small screens
   3. 4 rows of 1 column in extra small screens
2. I styled the button to be flashing and green
3. I styled the table to be more aesthetically pleasing
